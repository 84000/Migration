While the heart of the chapter is a transcript of the “Present Day Rite,” the text is interwoven with numerous narrative asides, depicting the spiritual ferment of the north Indian region of Magadha during the Buddha’s lifetime, the follies of untrained and unsupervised apprentices, and the need for a formal system of tutelage.'},\n",

       "     'content': 'The Vinayavastu is similar in its themes to the Theravādin Khandhaka (Skt. Skandhaka) still extant in Pali.[11] Both detail the communal rites, formal procedures, and disciplinary measures that give order and coherence to the monastic community as well as the types of clothes, food, shelter, and medicine allowed community members.[12] To appropriate Prebish’s useful explanation of the differences between the Skandhaka and Sūtravibhaṅga[13] and apply it here by way of analogy, while the Vinayavibhaṅga describes the vows that govern individual behavior, the Vinayavastu spells out the rules that govern communal behavior. This communal emphasis is immediately apparent when one considers the contents of the Vinayavastu’s seventeen chapters:\\n1. The Pravrajyāvastu (The Chapter on Going Forth) details the development of the rite by which one goes forth and becomes a Buddhist monk.[14]\\n2. The Poṣadhavastu (The Chapter on the Restoration Rite) describes the twice-monthly poṣadha ceremony.[15]\\n3. The Pravāraṇavastu (The Chapter on Lifting Restrictions) describes the pravāraṇa ceremony in which restrictions adopted for the rains retreat are lifted, marking the end of the rains retreat.[16]\\n4. The Varṣāvastu (The Chapter on the Rains) describes the timing and procedures for the annual rains retreat.[17]\\n5. The Carmavastu (The Chapter on Leather) details the rules regarding the use of leather hides for clothing, footwear, bedding, and seating.\\n6. The Bhaiṣajyavastu (The Chapter on Medicines) discusses the medicines allowed monastics, such as ghee, sesame oil, honey, and molasses; what monastics should not consume, such as human flesh; and related subjects, such as how medicine should be stored, under what circumstances monastics are allowed to cook for themselves, and how to respond to a hostile doctor.[18]\\n7. The Cīvaravastu (The Chapter on Robes) describes the types of material suitable to be turned into robes, such as silk, cotton, wool, linen, hemp, dugūla, koṭampa, and Aparāntin cloth, and presents specifications about the shape and form of those robes.[19]\\n8. The Kaṭhinavastu (The Chapter on Turning Cloth into Robes) describes the rules regulating the acceptance of cloth and turning it into robes.[20]\\n9. The Kauśāmbakavastu (The Chapter on the Monks of Kauśāmbī) outlines the procedures adopted to arbitrate disputes and allows for expulsion from the saṅgha community. These procedures were formulated in the wake of a major dispute that arose when the monks of Kauśāmbī expelled a group of monks from Vaiśālī.\\n10. The Karmavastu (The Chapter on Formal Acts of the Saṅgha) gives a short summary of the one hundred and one different official acts that require the saṅgha community’s sanction. These acts all fall into one of three categories depending on the procedure needed for ratification: acts of motion alone require only a motion; acts whose second member is a motion require a motion followed by the statement of the act; and acts whose fourth member is a motion require a motion followed by the statement of the act, repeated three times.\\n11. The Pāṇḍulohitakavastu (The Chapter on a Group of Troublesome Monks) details the five types of disciplinary acts that may be imposed on intransigent monastics, such as censure, chastening, expulsion, reconciliation, and suspension. Its name derives from the site of a dispute in which quarrelsome monks refused to admit to their guilt.[21]\\n12. The Pudgalavastu (The Chapter on Types of Persons) details appropriate and inappropriate times for the confession of breaches in discipline.\\n13. The Pārivāsikavastu (The Chapter on Probations) describes how to discipline, through the imposition of probations and penances, a monk who has a incurred saṅgha stigmata offense. This chapter also allows for such a monk’s reinstatement as a full member of the community upon successful completion of a probation and penance.\\n14. The Poṣadhasthāpanavastu (The Chapter on the Suspension of the Restoration Rite) describes the circumstances in which the restoration rite may be suspended and details the restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the restoration.\\n15. The Śayanāsanavastu (The Chapter on Shelter) discusses the types of shelter suitable for monastics, such as temples, multi-story buildings, verandas, sheds, wooden huts, earthen and rock caves, grass huts, and so on.[22]\\n16. The Adhikaraṇavastu (The Chapter on Disputes) discusses the seven means to resolve disputes that arise from disagreements over the Buddha’s teachings, reproaches regarding another monk’s conduct, offenses, or acts of saṅgha.\\n17. The Saṅghabhedavastu (The Chapter on Schism in the Saṅgha) narrates at length the Buddha’s youth, awakening, and ministry, as well as the schism prompted by Devadatta.'},\n",

There are no results or fruitions from performing good deeds or bad deeds. There is no present life. There is no afterlife. There is no mother. There is no father. Sentient beings are not born miraculously.[87] In the world [F.24.a] there are no arhats who have reached perfection, who have entered perfection, who can knowingly say that through their heightened insight they have seen this and future lives, and proclaim, ‘We have overcome birth. We have lived the holy life. We have done what needed to be done. We will know no life other than this.’ One’s life-force persists for the duration of this life but is annihilated after that. It will perish and after death will not arise again. A person’s body is forged from the four great elements, for once its time is up, the body’s solid structures recede[88] into earth, the body’s fluids recede into water, the body’s heat recedes into fire, and the body’s vital energies recede into wind. The senses fade into space. A person’s corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned, never to be seen again. What burns turns to ash. The bones turn a pigeon-like grey. Those who are confused about these things counsel giving alms, while the wise counsel receiving them. Those who argue that such things exist are all vainly debating what is empty and hollow. Both the childish and the wise will cease to be. They will perish and after death will not live again.”'},\n",

[F.26.a] What are the seven? The seven are thus: the body of earth, the body of water, the body of fire, the body of wind, pleasure, pain, and the vitality of life. Those seven bodies are not products, are not by-products, are not apparitions, are not by-products of apparitions, are not subject to harm, are everlasting, and are still and solid like a pillar. Those seven are such that they do not waver, they do not change, nor do they harm one another, nor do they become merit, nor do they become sin, nor do they become both merit and sin, nor do they become pleasure, nor do they become pain, nor do they become both pleasure and pain. [S.10.b] Were one person to cut off the head of another person, even that would not influence the world nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solid, for the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies, leaving the life within them unharmed. There is absolutely no killing them, no making to kill them, no rousing them, no making to rouse them, no awareness of them, no making to be aware of them, no knowing them, and no making them known. Whether you be childish or wise, you are liberated from suffering after 8,400,000 eons; in the meantime, you are reborn in and cycle through 14,000 principal places of rebirth, 60,600 great eons, five types of actions, three types of actions, two types of actions, action, half-actions, sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate eons, thirty-six hells, one hundred and twenty senses, sixty-two constituent particles, 49,000 classes of nāga families, 49,000 classes of garuḍa, 49,000 classes of wandering mendicants, [F.26.b] 49,000 classes of ājivika, 49,000 classes of nirgrantha, seven realms with discerning awareness, seven realms lacking discerning awareness, seven nirgrantha realms, seven demi-god realms, seven demonic realms, seven godly realms, seven human realms, seven great oceans, seven hundred lakes, seven great dreams, seven hundred dreams, seven states of great diminishment, seven hundred states of diminishment, seven states of great increase, seven hundred states of increase, seven states of great depletion, seven hundred states of depletion, seven great abysses, seven hundred abysses, six noble clans, ten high-status rebirths, and the eight grounds of a great person. Thus, just as a ball of thread thrown in the air unravels into a long thread as it falls, everyone, be they childish or wise, is liberated from suffering after having been through the cycle of rebirth for 8,400,000 eons. No ascetic or brahmin can say, ‘By observing ethics, a vow, asceticism, or celibacy, I shall bring to fruition those acts that have not borne fruit, and in facing those acts that have borne fruit, purify them.’ Our pleasures and pains are predestined.

Venerable, the Blessed One, the tathāgata, arhat, perfectly awakened, omniscient, all-seeing Buddha declared that any monk who claims to have attained the final superhuman quality, or an exalted or specific superhuman human quality, while in a state of nonperception or nondiscernment,[134] one who, while devoid of knowledge, insight, and first-hand experience,[135] claims, ‘I know this, I have seen this,’ even though he has not, that monk incurs a defeat, unless at some other time, wanting to come clean about the offense that has occurred, he says, at another’s urging or not, ‘Venerables, I declared I knew something I did not know. I declared I saw something I did not see. I spoke duplicitously and fraudulently,’ in which case it is only excessive pride.'},\n",

This first chapter traces the development of the rite by which postulants were admitted into the monastic order, from the Buddha Śākyamuni’s informal invitation to “Come, monk,” to the more elaborate “Present Day Rite.” Along the way, the posts of preceptor and instructor are introduced, their responsibilities defined, and a dichotomy between elders and immature novices described. While the heart of the chapter is a transcript of the “Present Day Rite,” the text is interwoven with numerous narrative asides, depicting the spiritual ferment of the north Indian region of Magadha during the Buddha’s lifetime, the follies of untrained and unsupervised apprentices, and the need for a formal system of tutelage.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Vinayavastu is similar in its themes to the Theravādin Khandhaka (Skt. Skandhaka) still extant in Pali.[11] Both detail the communal rites, formal procedures, and disciplinary measures that give order and coherence to the monastic community as well as the types of clothes, food, shelter, and medicine allowed community members.[12] To appropriate Prebish’s useful explanation of the differences between the Skandhaka and Sūtravibhaṅga[13] and apply it here by way of analogy, while the Vinayavibhaṅga describes the vows that govern individual behavior, the Vinayavastu spells out the rules that govern communal behavior. This communal emphasis is immediately apparent when one considers the contents of the Vinayavastu’s seventeen chapters:\\n1. The Pravrajyāvastu (The Chapter on Going Forth) details the development of the rite by which one goes forth and becomes a Buddhist monk.[14]\\n2. The Poṣadhavastu (The Chapter on the Restoration Rite) describes the twice-monthly poṣadha ceremony.[15]\\n3. The Pravāraṇavastu (The Chapter on Lifting Restrictions) describes the pravāraṇa ceremony in which restrictions adopted for the rains retreat are lifted, marking the end of the rains retreat.[16]\\n4. The Varṣāvastu (The Chapter on the Rains) describes the timing and procedures for the annual rains retreat.[17]\\n5. The Carmavastu (The Chapter on Leather) details the rules regarding the use of leather hides for clothing, footwear, bedding, and seating.\\n6. The Bhaiṣajyavastu (The Chapter on Medicines) discusses the medicines allowed monastics, such as ghee, sesame oil, honey, and molasses; what monastics should not consume, such as human flesh; and related subjects, such as how medicine should be stored, under what circumstances monastics are allowed to cook for themselves, and how to respond to a hostile doctor.[18]\\n7. The Cīvaravastu (The Chapter on Robes) describes the types of material suitable to be turned into robes, such as silk, cotton, wool, linen, hemp, dugūla, koṭampa, and Aparāntin cloth, and presents specifications about the shape and form of those robes.[19]\\n8. The Kaṭhinavastu (The Chapter on Turning Cloth into Robes) describes the rules regulating the acceptance of cloth and turning it into robes.[20]\\n9. The Kauśāmbakavastu (The Chapter on the Monks of Kauśāmbī) outlines the procedures adopted to arbitrate disputes and allows for expulsion from the saṅgha community. These procedures were formulated in the wake of a major dispute that arose when the monks of Kauśāmbī expelled a group of monks from Vaiśālī.\\n10. The Karmavastu (The Chapter on Formal Acts of the Saṅgha) gives a short summary of the one hundred and one different official acts that require the saṅgha community’s sanction. These acts all fall into one of three categories depending on the procedure needed for ratification: acts of motion alone require only a motion; acts whose second member is a motion require a motion followed by the statement of the act; and acts whose fourth member is a motion require a motion followed by the statement of the act, repeated three times.\\n11. The Pāṇḍulohitakavastu (The Chapter on a Group of Troublesome Monks) details the five types of disciplinary acts that may be imposed on intransigent monastics, such as censure, chastening, expulsion, reconciliation, and suspension. Its name derives from the site of a dispute in which quarrelsome monks refused to admit to their guilt.[21]\\n12. The Pudgalavastu (The Chapter on Types of Persons) details appropriate and inappropriate times for the confession of breaches in discipline.\\n13. The Pārivāsikavastu (The Chapter on Probations) describes how to discipline, through the imposition of probations and penances, a monk who has a incurred saṅgha stigmata offense. This chapter also allows for such a monk’s reinstatement as a full member of the community upon successful completion of a probation and penance.\\n14. The Poṣadhasthāpanavastu (The Chapter on the Suspension of the Restoration Rite) describes the circumstances in which the restoration rite may be suspended and details the restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the restoration.\\n15. The Śayanāsanavastu (The Chapter on Shelter) discusses the types of shelter suitable for monastics, such as temples, multi-story buildings, verandas, sheds, wooden huts, earthen and rock caves, grass huts, and so on.[22]\\n16. The Adhikaraṇavastu (The Chapter on Disputes) discusses the seven means to resolve disputes that arise from disagreements over the Buddha’s teachings, reproaches regarding another monk’s conduct, offenses, or acts of saṅgha.\\n17. The Saṅghabhedavastu (The Chapter on Schism in the Saṅgha) narrates at length the Buddha’s youth, awakening, and ministry, as well as the schism prompted by Devadatta.',\n",

       "  'content': 'A great many of our translation choices are based on glosses given by the late eighth-century master Kalyāṇamitra[49] in his Extensive Commentary on The Chapters of Discipline.[50] On the whole, Kalyāṇamitra’s citations mirror the relevant passages from the root text. However, there is enough variation between the root text and his commentary\\u200d—direct quotations purportedly from the root text which have no correlate in any of the Tibetan redactions, important passages of the root text not glossed in the commentary, differences in key terms\\u200d—to suggest Kalyāṇamitra may have been working from a different edition of the Vinayavastu than that which was available to the Tibetan translators and their Indian informants.[51] And although it does not bear directly on the present work, it should also be noted that the Tibetan translation of Kalyāṇamitra’s commentary appears to be incomplete. Presumably, Kalyāṇamitra commented on all seventeen chapters of the Vinayavastu, but the Degé, Coné, and Narthang editions of his commentary all end abruptly after the thirteenth fascicle, four pages into his comments on the Vinayavastu’s third chapter, the Pravāraṇāvastu.[52]',\n",

Sentient beings are not born miraculously.[87] In the world [F.24.a] there are no arhats who have reached perfection, who have entered perfection, who can knowingly say that through their heightened insight they have seen this and future lives, and proclaim, ‘We have overcome birth. We have lived the holy life. We have done what needed to be done. We will know no life other than this.’ One’s life-force persists for the duration of this life but is annihilated after that. It will perish and after death will not arise again. A person’s body is forged from the four great elements, for once its time is up, the body’s solid structures recede[88] into earth, the body’s fluids recede into water, the body’s heat recedes into fire, and the body’s vital energies recede into wind. The senses fade into space. A person’s corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned, never to be seen again. What burns turns to ash. The bones turn a pigeon-like grey. Those who are confused about these things counsel giving alms, while the wise counsel receiving them. Those who argue that such things exist are all vainly debating what is empty and hollow. Both the childish and the wise will cease to be. They will perish and after death will not live again.”',\n",

[F.26.a] What are the seven? The seven are thus: the body of earth, the body of water, the body of fire, the body of wind, pleasure, pain, and the vitality of life. Those seven bodies are not products, are not by-products, are not apparitions, are not by-products of apparitions, are not subject to harm, are everlasting, and are still and solid like a pillar. Those seven are such that they do not waver, they do not change, nor do they harm one another, nor do they become merit, nor do they become sin, nor do they become both merit and sin, nor do they become pleasure, nor do they become pain, nor do they become both pleasure and pain. [S.10.b] Were one person to cut off the head of another person, even that would not influence the world nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solid, for the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies, leaving the life within them unharmed. There is absolutely no killing them, no making to kill them, no rousing them, no making to rouse them, no awareness of them, no making to be aware of them, no knowing them, and no making them known. Whether you be childish or wise, you are liberated from suffering after 8,400,000 eons; in the meantime, you are reborn in and cycle through 14,000 principal places of rebirth, 60,600 great eons, five types of actions, three types of actions, two types of actions, action, half-actions, sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate eons, thirty-six hells, one hundred and twenty senses, sixty-two constituent particles, 49,000 classes of nāga families, 49,000 classes of garuḍa, 49,000 classes of wandering mendicants, [F.26.b] 49,000 classes of ājivika, 49,000 classes of nirgrantha, seven realms with discerning awareness, seven realms lacking discerning awareness, seven nirgrantha realms, seven demi-god realms, seven demonic realms, seven godly realms, seven human realms, seven great oceans, seven hundred lakes, seven great dreams, seven hundred dreams, seven states of great diminishment, seven hundred states of diminishment, seven states of great increase, seven hundred states of increase, seven states of great depletion, seven hundred states of depletion, seven great abysses, seven hundred abysses, six noble clans, ten high-status rebirths, and the eight grounds of a great person. Thus, just as a ball of thread thrown in the air unravels into a long thread as it falls, everyone, be they childish or wise, is liberated from suffering after having been through the cycle of rebirth for 8,400,000 eons. No ascetic or brahmin can say, ‘By observing ethics, a vow, asceticism, or celibacy, I shall bring to fruition those acts that have not borne fruit, and in facing those acts that have borne fruit, purify them.’ Our pleasures and pains are predestined. It is impossible to extend or reduce them. As this is how things are and not otherwise, the rounds of existence are thus to be counted.”',\n",
