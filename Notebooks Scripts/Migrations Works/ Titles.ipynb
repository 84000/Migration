The senses fade into space. A person’s corpse is borne on a bier carried by four men and taken to the charnel ground where it is burned, never to be seen again. What burns turns to ash. The bones turn a pigeon-like grey. Those who are confused about these things counsel giving alms, while the wise counsel receiving them.

[F.26.a] What are the seven? The seven are thus: the body of earth, the body of water, the body of fire, the body of wind, pleasure, pain, and the vitality of life. Those seven bodies are not products, are not by-products, are not apparitions, are not by-products of apparitions, are not subject to harm, are everlasting, and are still and solid like a pillar. Those seven are such that they do not waver, they do not change, nor do they harm one another, nor do they become merit, nor do they become sin, nor do they become both merit and sin, nor do they become pleasure, nor do they become pain, nor do they become both pleasure and pain. [S.10.b] Were one person to cut off the head of another person, even that would not influence the world nor would it cause the slightest harm to that which is still and solid, for the weapon would pass straight through the unbroken spaces in those seven bodies, leaving the life within them unharmed. There is absolutely no killing them, no making to kill them, no rousing them, no making to rouse them, no awareness of them, no making to be aware of them, no knowing them, and no making them known. Whether you be childish or wise, you are liberated from suffering after 8,400,000 eons; in the meantime, you are reborn in and cycle through 14,000 principal places of rebirth, 60,600 great eons, five types of actions, three types of actions, two types of actions, action, half-actions, sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediate eons, thirty-six hells, one hundred and twenty senses, sixty-two constituent particles, 49,000 classes of nāga families, 49,000 classes of garuḍa, 49,000 classes of wandering mendicants, [F.26.b] 49,000 classes of ājivika, 49,000 classes of nirgrantha, seven realms with discerning awareness, seven realms lacking discerning awareness, seven nirgrantha realms, seven demi-god realms, seven demonic realms, seven godly realms, seven human realms, seven great oceans, seven hundred lakes, seven great dreams, seven hundred dreams, seven states of great diminishment, seven hundred states of diminishment, seven states of great increase, seven hundred states of increase, seven states of great depletion, seven hundred states of depletion, seven great abysses, seven hundred abysses, six noble clans, ten high-status rebirths, and the eight grounds of a great person. Thus, just as a ball of thread thrown in the air unravels into a long thread as it falls, everyone, be they childish or wise, is liberated from suffering after having been through the cycle of rebirth for 8,400,000 eons. No ascetic or brahmin can say, ‘By observing ethics, a vow, asceticism, or celibacy, I shall bring to fruition those acts that have not borne fruit, and in facing those acts that have borne fruit, purify them.’ Our pleasures and pains are predestined.
