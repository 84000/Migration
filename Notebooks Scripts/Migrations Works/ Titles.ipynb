In each of the three long sutras, the discussions between the Buddha and the other interlocutors on these sets of dharmas follow one another in almost identical sequence, and the differences in length among the three are almost entirely due to the different degrees to which each set is unpacked into the individual items that it comprises.'},\n",

A large majority of passages are common to the two versions and nearly identical; to describe the Tengyur version as a different translation is therefore somewhat misleading. At the same time, the fact that the later translation was probably made using the earlier as its starting point does not necessarily imply the same chronological relationship between the two Sanskrit source texts.

Four practices are taught (armor-like, engagement, accumulation, and deliverance), and then, in some detail, eight aspects related to the “persevering.” The last of these eight is a discussion, starting with chapter 8, that arrives at an authoritative conclusion, including twenty-eight or twenty-nine questions, further dialogue between Subhūti and Śāriputra, and in chapters 11, 12, and 13 a long discussion of the Great Vehicle, its attributes, and its results.

Subsequent chapters cover a range of topics, from the dedication of merit, in chapter 24, up to how a bodhisattva’s progress to awakening becomes irreversible, in chapter 40.

Śāriputra then asks for more detail, and the Buddha’s response forms the entirety of the rest of the long chapter, which is accordingly known as the “Śāriputra chapter” and forms a survey of what is meant by the bodhisattva’s practice of the perfection of wisdom that is relatively easy to understand\\u200d—suggesting that it is the material particularly appropriate to Śāriputra’s perspective. Nevertheless, in subsequent chapters, Śāriputra continues to participate. He does so mainly by asking questions, many of them put to Subhūti rather than to the Buddha himself, and makes few statements of his own. Nevertheless, he is wise and experienced enough even to be able to correct a misunderstanding of Śakra’s at one point (25.\\xad6). Śāriputra is appreciative and respectful of the teaching, and wants to understand it in terms of his own framework. The other interlocutors treat Śāriputra’s perspective on it respectfully.

As an arhat, he is declared by the Buddha in the canonical literature to hold two distinctions of the “foremost among…” type: “foremost among those worthy of donations” and “foremost among those dwelling free of afflicted mental states.”[71] In the Chinese canon he has another distinction, that of being “foremost among those dwelling in meditation on emptiness.”[72] Despite these mentions of his distinctions Subhūti figures surprisingly rarely in the Pali canon.[73] In the Mūlasarvāstivāda vinaya corpus he seems to be mentioned even less, but the one story about him, found in the Vinayakṣudrakavastu (Toh 6) as well as in the Pali paracanonical literature, is perhaps significant in explaining his interest in the most profound views;[74] it has also traditionally been used to place the timing of the Prajñāpāramitā teachings in the main events of the Buddha’s life.[75] In the Lokottaravāda Mahāvastu he does not appear at all. In the Mahāyāna sūtras, however, he figures much more frequently, and his appearances as a protagonist mostly show him in a respectful light that conforms to the personal characteristics alluded to in the Pali and Mūlasarvastivāda literature: those of someone interested above all in meditative practice and the profound view of impermanence, emptiness, nonself, and the ultimate that transcends conceptual notions.[76] In the Lotus Sūtra he is one of the small group of śrāvakas whose future full awakening to buddhahood is prophesied by the Buddha.[77] On the other hand, there are also a few Mahāyāna works, as there are for other śrāvaka disciples, in which he is demonstratively outclassed by bodhisattvas.[78]'},\n",

The important role of śrāvakas in the past teaching the six perfections to future bodhisattvas, and thus ensuring the emergence of future buddhas, is mentioned by Subhūti in chapter 14 (14.\\xad27). If there is nevertheless any basis for a śrāvaka teaching the perfection of wisdom to be seen as paradoxical, it is exposed and dispelled early on, at least from a formal perspective. No sooner has the Buddha asked Subhūti to teach than some of the arhats and bodhisattvas present wonder whether he will teach using his own understanding and inspired speech, or through the power of the Buddha (3.\\xad2); Subhūti replies immediately (3.\\xad3) that a śrāvaka like him can only teach anything through the power of the Buddha. A good deal of room for interpretation is nonetheless left in this passage\\u200d—first in what is meant by “inspired speech” (pratibhāna, spobs pa), then also in the details of Subhūti’s disclaimer, but most of all in the way Subhūti begins to respond to what the Buddha has asked him to do (3.\\xad4). For instead of launching straight into a teaching of his own, he asks how he could possibly teach bodhisattvas a perfection of wisdom when neither bodhisattvas nor a perfection of wisdom can be identified other than their mere designations. This key prompt elicits a long teaching by the Buddha on just that topic that lasts for several chapters, punctuated by further questions from Subhūti and long statements by him addressed either to the Buddha, or to Sāriputra when the latter again asks for clarification.

This reminder of Subhūti’s standing, after so much brilliance displayed in so many of his discourses, may come as something of a shock.

It is not the wisdom itself, which is single and undifferentiated whether for a śrāvaka or a bodhisattva; it is the motivation for seeking to realize it. Bodhisattvas seek that wisdom in order to bring all beings to enlightenment.

The long section featuring Śakra and the gods, from chapter 14 through 23, is known as the Śakra section of the text, but in fact Śakra continues to contribute to the conversation by asking pertinent questions in subsequent chapters, too. Ostensibly Śakra and the gods are present to promise their support of bodhisattvas who practice the perfection of wisdom, but Śakra’s questions to the Buddha and to Subhūti provide many more opportunities for everyone present to learn about further aspects of the perfection of wisdom. Śakra is clearly a wise and highly intelligent leader in his own right, with the broad perspective over time and place that goes with his status. However, at one point (30.\\xad6) the Buddha, having congratulated Śakra on having thought to ask such a good question, then goes on to remark that it is through the power of the buddhas that Śakra’s questions arise.'},\n",

Using miraculous displays through their great extrasensory powers,[98] their extrasensory powers never failing, and with engaging speech,[99] without indolence but with perseverance, without regard for their bodies or their lives, their conduct unpretentious, without insincerity, and without thoughts of ulterior fame, profit, or respect, free from self-interest they taught the Dharma.

Their progress was governed by their aspiration to establish infinite buddhafields. Constantly and uninterruptedly they brought into being the meditative stability of recollecting the buddhas who reside in countless world systems; they were skilled in attending buddhas wherever they appear and skilled in requesting innumerable buddhas to teach. They were skilled in bringing about peace from the afflicted mental states that are generated through the diverse false views of beings, and skilled in bringing forth realization of the wisdom that revels in the miraculous production of a hundred thousand meditative stabilities.

I am about to be prophesied. I should refine the buddhafields. I should bring beings to maturation. I should attain manifest buddhahood in unsurpassed, complete enlightenment.

If you ask why, when bodhisattva great beings practice the perfection of wisdom, the perception of beings does not arise. The perception of a self, life forms, life, living creatures, persons, human beings, people, actors, experiencers, knowers, and viewers does not arise.

Śāradvatīputra, [F.61.a] bodhisattva great beings who practice the perfection of wisdom in that manner practice the perfection of wisdom based on [the truth that] beings are nonarising.
